# pollen-count-scraper

Met Éireann's [pollen forecast](https://www.met.ie/forecasts/pollen) is really useful, but the info isn't available in [the MÉ API](https://data.gov.ie/dataset/met-eireann-weather-forecast-api/resource/5d156b15-38b8-4de9-921b-0ffc8704c88e).

So to make up for it until they add pollen count as an endpoint we'll use this scraper.
